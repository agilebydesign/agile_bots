  "typical_assumptions": [
    "Parent-child: Domain collection objects (explicit collection class encapsulates collection-level operations)",
    "Object instantiation: Constructor injection (dependencies explicit and immutable at creation)",
    "Integration: Direct in-process calls (module based, synchronous, simple)",
    "Persistence: Repository abstraction (domain objects persistence-ignorant)",
    "UI interaction: Direct domain binding (simple forms, domain matches UI)",
    "Error handling: Throw domain exceptions (exceptional conditions with meaningful domain error types)",
    "Concurrency: Optimistic locking (assume conflicts rare, check version at save)"
