    "Domain concepts emerge from stories and business language, not technical implementation",

    "Focus on core domain concepts first, supporting concepts later",
    "Concepts are placed at the most specific level (sub-epic) and elevated to parent level only if shared",
    "Each bounded context has its own view of domain concepts with specific meanings",
    "Domain concepts capture WHAT exists in the business domain, not HOW it's implemented",
    "Responsibilities describe what a concept does in the business domain",
    "Collaborators show which concepts work together to accomplish business goals",
    "Relationships between concepts should reflect business rules and constraints",
    "Domain language should be understood by both business and technical teams",
    "Avoid generic technical terms (Manager, Handler, Service, Controller) in concept names",
    "Favor nouns and resources over verbs and actions",
    "Domain concepts should be technology-agnostic and implementation-independent",
    "Start lightweight - concept names and responsibilities - then add detail as needed",
    "Domain model refinement happens iteratively as understanding deepens",
    "Existing code and documentation are sources for concept discovery, not the definition",
    "Sub-epics typically represent bounded contexts with cohesive domain concepts"
