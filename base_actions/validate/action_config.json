    "Carefully review all scanner-reported violations as follows:",
    "1. For each violation message, locate the corresponding element in the story graph.",
    "2. Open the relevant rule file and read all DO and DON'T examples thoroughly.",
    "3. Decide if the violation is **Valid** (truly a rule breach per examples) or a **False Positive** (explain why if so).",
    "4. Determine the **Root Cause** (e.g., 'incorrect concept naming', 'missing actor', etc.).",
    "5. Assign a **Theme** grouping based on the type of issue (e.g., 'noun-only naming', 'incomplete acceptance criteria').",
    "6. Extract an **Example** from the actual code/content showing the problem.",
    "7. Suggest a clear, concrete **Fix** with a code example informed by DO examples in the rule.",

    "Scanner tools don't cover or catch every rule violation. Do a second pass:",
    "1. Carefully read each rule file, fully reviewing DO and DON'T sections, and every provided example.",
    "2. Inspect {scope} for compliance.",
    "3. Compare the properties and content of each element against the rule's requirements.",
    "4. Document any violations the scanner could not find.",
