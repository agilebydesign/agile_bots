  "question": "How deeply should relationships between domain concepts be modeled?",
  "options": [
    "No relationships - Just list concepts independently",
    "Collaborators only - List which concepts work together",
    "Basic relationships - Collaborators with relationship types (has-a, uses, contains)",
    "Detailed relationships - Include cardinality, directionality, lifecycle dependencies",
    "Full relationship model - Everything including invariants and business rules"
  ],
  "note": "Deeper relationship modeling helps with architecture but adds complexity to the model."
