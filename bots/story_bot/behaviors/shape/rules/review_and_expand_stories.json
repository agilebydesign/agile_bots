When planning decisions specify 'System stories' or detailed component interactions, MUST break down existing stories into component-interaction stories. The story count WILL increase. NOTE: This rule operates on a different axis than P13 (Consolidate Superficial Stories). P14 decomposes by system component behavior (different behaviors within one story). P13 eliminates data-value duplication (same behavior, different input values). Apply P13 first to consolidate data variations, then apply P14 to expand by component behavior.",
