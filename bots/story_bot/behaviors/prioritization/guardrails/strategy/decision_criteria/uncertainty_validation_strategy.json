  "question": "What is the earliest uncertainty you need to validate?",
  "options": [
    "Architecture/Reuse - validate foundational patterns and reusable components early to prevent downstream rework",
    "Impact - validate whether users care, intend to use, or will act on the solution (e.g., Wizard of Oz, landing pages, stubs)",
    "Operations - validate operational readiness, deployment, monitoring, and support capabilities",
    "System Integration - validate integration points with external systems, APIs, or partners"
  ]
