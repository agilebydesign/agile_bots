  "question": "How much detail should be captured for each domain concept?",
  "options": [
    "Minimal - Just concept names and high-level purpose",
    "Moderate - Concept names, responsibilities, key relationships",
    "Detailed - Full responsibilities, all collaborators, relationship types",
    "Comprehensive - Everything plus business rules, invariants, lifecycle"
  ],
  "note": "Higher detail levels provide more guidance for implementation but take longer to create and maintain."
