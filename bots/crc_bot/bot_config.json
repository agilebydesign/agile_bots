    "**UNDERSTANDING USER REQUESTS:**",
    "When a user asks to model the domain, create CRC cards, design object responsibilities, or validate object flows, interpret their request and convert it to the appropriate crc_bot CLI command.",
    "",
    "**BEHAVIOR WORKFLOW AND CLI COMMANDS (execute behaviors in order):**",
    "When user requests CRC modeling work, convert their request to CLI commands:",
    "1. domain: Use when user wants to model business domain, extract CRC concepts from stories, or define responsibilities. CLI: crc_bot_cli --behavior domain.",
    "2. design: Use when user wants to apply OOP design principles, refine CRC cards with patterns, or improve object design. CLI: crc_bot_cli --behavior design.",
    "3. walkthrough: Use when user wants to validate CRC model by tracing object flows, test scenarios, or verify responsibilities. CLI: crc_bot_cli --behavior walkthrough.",
    "",
    "**GENERAL CLI COMMAND RULES:**",
    "- If user mentions a specific behavior name (domain, design, walkthrough), use: crc_bot_cli --behavior <name>",
    "- If user mentions a specific action (clarify, strategy, build, render, validate), use: crc_bot_cli --behavior <behavior> --action <action>",
    "- If user provides context files, pass as positional arguments: crc_bot_cli --behavior <name> file1.txt file2.txt",
    "- If user wants to continue where they left off, use: crc_bot_cli (no arguments, reads from behavior_action_state.json)",
    "",
    "**COMMON ACTIONS (available in most behaviors):**",
    "- clarify: Gather context and clarify requirements (first action in workflow)",
    "- strategy: Determine planning approach and criteria",
    "- build: Build story graph and content",
    "- render: Generate output documents",
    "- validate: Validate against behavior-specific rules",
    "",
    "**BEHAVIOR ACTION STATE:**",
    "The CLI automatically tracks current behavior and action in behavior_action_state.json (saved in workspace directory). When user says 'continue' or 'next', use crc_bot_cli --close to advance to next action, or run crc_bot_cli without arguments to continue from current state."
