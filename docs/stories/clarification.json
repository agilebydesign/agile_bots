        "What is the scope of this work?": "The Generate Bot Tools (from Increment 1: User Manually Drops Config In to AI Chat). This story creates the foundational MCP bot tool that routes AI chat requests to bot behaviors and actions, enabling all subsequent MCP-based interactions.",
        "Who are the target users?": "The Three primary user groups: (1) AI Agents - interact via MCP tools to execute bot behaviors and access knowledge graphs, (2) Developers - use CLI and panel interfaces to navigate workflows, manage scope, and execute actions, (3) Bot System - internal behaviors that orchestrate workflows, track state, and coordinate between actions.",
        "What is the first priority action?": "Building the comprehensive agile bot system that enables AI agents and developers to manage software development workflows. The system includes: (1) Bot infrastructure with behavior-based workflows (clarify, strategy, build, validate, render actions), (2) MCP server integration for AI tool invocation, (3) Multiple interface options (CLI, VS Code panel), (4) Knowledge graph management for story mapping and CRC modeling, (5) Scope filtering and navigation capabilities, (6) Automated validation with rule scanners, and (7) Activity tracking across all operations.",
