            (E) Trace Code
                    (S) Developer --> Display Code Trace
                        (AC) WHEN Developer views scenario with linked test THEN Trace Editor parses test method for function/method calls AND follows each call to find implementation AND builds call hierarchy
                        (AC) WHEN Trace Editor builds hierarchy THEN displays test method as root node AND called functions as child nodes AND recursively traces calls AND expands to 3 levels by default
                        (AC) WHEN Trace Editor displays code box THEN shows symbol name AND file path and line number AND source code with syntax highlighting AND line numbers
                        (AC) WHEN hierarchy exceeds 3 levels THEN shows collapsed nodes beyond level 3 AND lazy-loads deeper levels on expand
                        (AC) WHEN call target not found in workspace THEN skips external/library calls BUT continues tracing other calls
                        (AC) WHEN scenario has no linked test THEN shows "No test linked" indicator BUT does not show error
                        (AC) WHEN linked test file not found THEN shows test reference with warning indicator BUT still renders trace UI structure
                        (AC) WHEN test method has no calls THEN displays empty code trace section
                        (AC) WHEN call tree exceeds depth limit THEN truncates at maximum depth AND shows truncation indicator
                    (S) Developer --> Edit Code Step
                        (AC) WHEN Trace Editor displays code trace THEN expands hierarchy by default AND displays code snippet in editable box AND shows line numbers
                        (AC) WHEN Developer modifies code and triggers save THEN saves changes to source file AND shows save confirmation indicator
                        (AC) WHEN Developer modifies test code THEN saves changes to test file
                        (AC) WHEN Developer modifies implementation code THEN saves changes to code file
                        (AC) WHEN save operation fails THEN shows error indicator BUT preserves user edits
                        (AC) WHEN Developer presses Escape THEN reverts to previous value BUT does not save changes
                    (S) Developer --> Open Source File
                        (AC) WHEN Developer clicks Open on code node THEN Editor opens source file AND navigates to specific line number
                        (AC) WHEN Developer clicks Open on test node THEN Editor opens test file AND navigates to test method line
                        (AC) WHEN source file not found THEN shows file not found error BUT does not crash
                        (AC) WHEN line number exceeds file length THEN Editor opens file at end AND shows line not found warning
                        (AC) WHEN Developer clicks Open while file already open THEN Editor focuses existing tab AND navigates to line
                    (S) Developer --> Navigate Code Trace
                        (AC) WHEN Developer clicks method call within code box THEN navigates to code box for that method AND scrolls hierarchy AND highlights target
                        (AC) WHEN Developer clicks property access THEN navigates to code box for that property
                        (AC) WHEN Developer clicks nested method/property call THEN expands parent nodes if collapsed AND navigates to nested code box
                        (AC) WHEN clicked method/property not in trace hierarchy THEN shows "Not traced" indicator BUT does not navigate
                        (AC) WHEN Developer expands code node THEN lazy-loads source code AND displays code with line numbers AND shows loading indicator
                        (AC) WHEN Developer collapses node THEN hides code snippet BUT preserves loaded content in memory
                        (AC) WHEN Developer clicks Expand All THEN expands entire hierarchy BUT does not auto-load code snippets
                        (AC) WHEN Developer clicks Collapse All THEN collapses entire hierarchy
                        (AC) WHEN Developer clicks Toggle Code THEN shows/hides code for all expanded nodes
                        (AC) WHEN Developer hovers over code node THEN shows full path tooltip
                        (AC) WHEN source file not found during lazy load THEN shows file not found message BUT does not collapse node
