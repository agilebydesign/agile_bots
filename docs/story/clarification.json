        "What is the scope of this work?": "Generate Bot Tools (from Increment: User Manually Drops Config In to AI Chat). This story creates the foundational MCP bot tool that routes AI chat requests to bot behaviors and actions, enabling all subsequent MCP-based interactions.",
        "Who are the target users?": "The Three primary user groups: (1) AI Agents - interact via MCP tools to execute bot behaviors and access knowledge graphs, (2) Developers - use CLI and panel interfaces to navigate workflows, manage scope, and execute actions, (3) Bot System - internal behaviors that orchestrate workflows, track state, and coordinate between actions.",
        "What is the first priority action?": "Building the comprehensive agile bot system that enables AI agents and developers to manage software development workflows. The system includes: (1) Bot infrastructure with behavior-based workflows (clarify, strategy, build, validate, render actions), (2) MCP server integration for AI tool invocation, (3) Multiple interface options (CLI, VS Code panel), (4) Knowledge graph management for story mapping and CRC modeling, (5) Scope filtering and navigation capabilities, (6) Automated validation with rule scanners, and (7) Activity tracking across all operations.",

      "answers": {
        "What is the scope of this work?": "Writing documentation/writeups for all Panel-related stories in the 'Work With Story Map' sub-epic. Based on the story graph, there are approximately 18 Panel stories across 6 sub-epics: Scope Files (3 stories), Filter Scope of Stories (3 stories), Manage Story Scope (1 story), Set Scope Using Filter Parts (4 stories), Edit Story Map (8 stories), Edit Increments (3 stories), Open Story Related Files (2 stories).",
        "Who are the target users for these writeups?": "Developers and end-users who interact with the Agile Bots VS Code panel to work with story maps. Based on the existing user guide structure, the documentation should explain how to use each panel feature.",
        "What format should the writeups follow?": "Looking at the existing user-guide.md structure, each section uses: Headers (##, ###), Brief description of feature purpose, Step-by-step instructions where applicable, Screenshots references (images), Tables for acceptance criteria or feature summaries.",
        "What information is available in the scope for each panel story?": "Each panel story in the scope contains: Story name, Acceptance criteria (WHEN/THEN statements), Scenarios with Given/When/Then steps, Test classes and test methods (where defined), Domain concepts (for Edit Story Map sub-epic).",
        "Where should this documentation be added?": "Section 17 'The Story Graph' in user-guide.md appears to be the appropriate location, as it already covers navigating and editing the story graph. The panel stories would expand this section with detailed feature documentation."
