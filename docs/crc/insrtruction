think through a domain model that adds to out current @docs/crc/domain/crc-model-outline.md 

-- > each format (drawio, MD, txt, mermaid , etc) follows a similart model

BaseStoryNode
      StoryNode <---- our current code API to read write stries in json *maybe call it JsonmStoryNode?
      DrawIoStoryNode <-- identical API but reads and writes a stroy map and its pieces to Drawio, can also read a a drawio story map
    MermaidStoryNode same but mermaid

All DrawIO, Mermaid, also exentrd from MtermaidAdapter, DwarioAdapter, etc


these have base ligic to read and wrote to those formats

we need the CRC outline to support DrawIOStoryMap.update(StoryMap)


where StoryMap could be anything that extends from baseStoryMap *whiche xtends from baseStoryNode BTW( 

so we could DrawIOStoryMap.update(StoryGraph(

or MermaidStoryMap.update(DraioStoryMap)


if a user updatresa a diagram we wqanrt to

StroyGraph.update(DrawioStoryMap)

given the object oriented nature of story We would want this update function to basically be and work on every in the graph

so StoryGraophEPic.update(DrawIOEpic)

would update as well as any changes to stories scenarios or whatever else is inside 


all versions need to emulate the base stroynode api

including supporitng move, rename, dleete, etc

we also need to support the idea of creating a rendered say drawio diagram changing it then updaring tyhe stroy graph, providing somewarnings iftings go wrong and vchanging the storey grtaph then renrendeing and for diagram s not lsiing any positining snd only adding remoiving oir chamngind

currently this functiuonality is captured here
 the code is TERRIBLE

a vibe code emss but you can see the features
